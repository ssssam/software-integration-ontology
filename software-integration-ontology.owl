# Working title: the "software integration ontology". First draft.
#
# This is intended as a BASE vocabulary for software build & integration
# instructions. Real build tools will have to make at a few extensions in
# order to have actual working build instructions.


# Partial OWL and RDF Schema glossary:
#
# domain: the set of objects that a can have a property.
# range: the set of possible values for a property.
#
# ObjectProperty:
#   a property whose value must be another resource.
# DatatypeProperty:
#   a property whose value is one of the datatype defined by XML Schema ("xsd")
# FunctionalProperty:
#   a property which can only have one value per resource
# InverseFunctionalProperty:
#   a property which can only have one resource per value

# This ontology.

:Artifact a owl:Class ;
  # This includes OSTree trees, Git trees, normal filesystem tres, individual
  # files, ...
  rdfs:comment "A file or set of files that is interesting for some reason." .

:Source a owl:Class ;
  # I don't know how useful it is to consider source code a type
  # of artifact, but in abstract terms it seems correct. I can't see where to
  # draw a line to say "this is source code" vs. "this is a built artifact",
  # because some source code can be executed without any kind of "build"
  # process.
  rdfs:subClassOf :Artifact ;
  rdfs:comment "A repository of source code." .

  rdfs:comment "An open-ended property that can be used for distinguishing between multiple variants of an artifact." ;
  rdfs:domain :Artifact .
  # No range defined at the moment, use any made up URL. E.G. when
  # distinguishing different artifacts that can be built from the source tree of
  # the Mesa graphics library, you might say ':hasFeature
  # <driver://intel-i915>'. Until projects provide their own vocabularies for
  # talking about the various feature options they have, you're going to be on
  # your own with this.

  # In future we need to come up with a formal vocabulary for machine
  # architectures. But that will be an ongoing maintenance burden.
