# Working title: the "software integration ontology".
#
# This is intended as a BASE vocabulary for software build & integration
# instructions. Real build tools will have to make at a few extensions in
# order to have actual working build instructions.

# Partial OWL and RDF Schema glossary:
#
# domain: the set of objects that a can have a property.
# range: the set of possible values for a property.
#
# ObjectProperty:
#   a property whose value must be another resource.
# DatatypeProperty:
#   a property whose value is one of the datatype defined by XML Schema ("xsd")
# FunctionalProperty:
#   a property which can only have one value per resource
# InverseFunctionalProperty:
#   a property which can only have one resource per value

# There are three main 'dimensions' to this data model. The first axis is the
# *build process*: source goes in, binaries come out. The second axis is
# grouping: for example, source code is represented files, which are grouped
# into packages. The third axis is containment: source files are contained in
# version control repos, packages are contained in package repos, etc.

# Nothing can be both Source and Binary. Some files pass through the build
# process without being transformed, but the output file should still be
# considered a different file to the input file. Use the Intermediate class
# for files that are generated as part of the build process but are not
# useful in themselves.

# There is only one type of "requirement" considered in this data model. In the
# real world you usually need to distinguish between whether something is a
# build-time requirement (e.g. foo.c requires foo.h) or a runtime requirement
# (e.g. foo-app requires libfoo.so). In this data model that information is
# implicit. If a :Binary requires something then it must be a runtime
# dependency. If a :Source or :BuildProcess requires something then it must be
# a built time dependency. Of course, anything required by a :Source is
# required by whatever process needs to build that source.

# These might be useful if you "combine" equivalent Source, Binary and

# describing relationships that are only needed when describing "combined"
# packages.

# As interesting as the terms that we include are the terms that we don't
# include, to avoid contradicting existing definitions.
#
# Component:
#
#   - Defined in "Large-Scale C++ Software Design" by John Lakos (1996) as "the
#     smallest unit of physical design", which is useful, but also as "exactly
#     one header (.h) file and one implementation (.c) file", which is too C/C++
#     specific to be useful in a general purpose data model.
#
# Package:
#
#   - In Apple's OS X operating system, a package is a file system directory
#     that gets displayed to the user as a single file.
#   - In Python, a package is more or less a directory that contains modules
#     (which are files) and/or other Python packages.
#   - In Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) a package is any collection of
#     files
#   - In Unified Modelling Language (UML) a package is an abstract logical
#     grouping used "to group elements, and to provide a namespace for the
#     grouped elements".
#   - Many package management tools (especially on GNU/Linux operating systems)
#     treat a package as a discrete component that can be installed, removed
#     or upgraded to a new version while the system is running.
#   - In "Large-Scale C++ Software Design", a package is "a collection of
#     components organized as a physically cohesive unit", and has a prefix
#     associated with it that should be preprended to all symbols within that
#     package. Lakos also defines "package groups", as "a collection of
#     packages organized as a physically cohesive unit".
